Colorizing grayscale images is a challenging computer vision task, particularly in the context of historical fashion archives where original color information is missing or undocumented. Accurate colorization plays an important role in visual restoration, cultural preservation, and public access, yet it also raises questions about historical authenticity and interpretive uncertainty.

This study compares CNN- and GAN-based deep learning architectures for colorizing Western historical fashion images using a dataset of 18th–20th century dress images from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ResNet AutoEncoder, U-Net, and Pix2Pix models were trained on paired color and grayscale images and evaluated using perceptual (SSIM) and pixel-level (PSNR) metrics.

Results show that Pix2Pix achieves the highest perceptual quality and color accuracy, outperforming CNN-based models across training stages, while ResNet provides stable color reconstruction and U-Net shows more limited improvements. The findings emphasize the importance of perceptual evaluation in historical image colorization and highlight the potential of GAN-based approaches for fashion heritage restoration and interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI and fashion history.
