This study examines how national identity is visually represented through the costumes of East Asian fighting game characters. Focusing on representative characters from Tekken and Street Fighter, the research analyzes how clothing, accessories, and styling elements are used to communicate cultural identity for Korean, Chinese, and Japanese characters.

The findings show that Japanese and Chinese characters tend to convey national identity through recognizable traditional garments and symbolic motifs, resulting in clear and consistent cultural representation. In contrast, Korean characters often display cultural inaccuracies or ambiguous design choices, which have led to criticism from players and raised concerns about distorted national representation. These cases demonstrate that character costumes function as a key form of visual storytelling rather than mere aesthetic decoration.

This study highlights the importance of cultural understanding and accuracy in game character costume design and argues for more responsible and informed approaches to representing national identity in global game content.            </p>
